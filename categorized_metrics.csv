The HomeActivityencompasses the home screen, browser screen, settings screen,collections and other screens in the nav_graph.This differs from the app_opened probe because it measures allstartups, not just cold startup. Note: There is a short gapbetween the time application goes into background and the timeandroid reports the application going into the background.Note: This metric does not record souce when app opened fromtask switcher: open application -> press home button -> openrecent tasks -> choose fenix.
